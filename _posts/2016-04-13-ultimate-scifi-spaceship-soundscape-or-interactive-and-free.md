description: "Star Trek's Enterprise engine noise has been a recurring request. A slight problem delayed its release: our user interface had more sliders than it needed to recreate the sound! ;) So, instead of designing just an engine noise, we decided to throw some extra sounds and turn the engine noise into a fully featured intergalactic experience."
